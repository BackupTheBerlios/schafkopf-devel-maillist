Subject: [Schafkopf-devel] SchafKopf ported to KDE4
Message-ID: <4F37F7D4.6060400@freenet.de>

Hi there,

I don't know who is still reading this, but I just want to announce that
I have ported SchafKopf to KDE4. There are still some small things that
don't work yet (e.g. make install, which means no translations) but in
general it should run just like back in good old KDE3 times.

CVS is now dead as I moved SchafKopf to github:
https://github.com/benni0815/SchafKopf

To get the code just do a
git clone git://github.com/benni0815/SchafKopf.git

To compile you will need the development packages of libkdegames and
qimageblitz (libkdegames-dev and libqimageblitz-dev on Ubuntu).
SchafKopf will try to use the "XSkat German" card deck which you might
need to install through your package manager.

We will do a release when the remaining bugs are fixed, but we are also
looking forward to receive some patches. :-)

Greetings

Benni
